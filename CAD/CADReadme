This is where all CAD files will go, github allows version control so we don't need to fuck around with "strut v2 is missing from this assembly" stuff, 
if you're uploading a new version of a part, create a new branch, replace the file in the branch and then make a pull request to pull it into the main 
branch once its finalised

Github does not recognise folders unless they have something in them so to create a new folder you must create file, type the name of the folder, type "/" 
and then the name of a file
